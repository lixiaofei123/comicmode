When you read comics on nextcloud, you may need this plugin to help you read better.

We provide a more user-friendly UI interface, allowing you to read like on a comic site. We also support the automatic recognition of comic sequences, and automatically analyze the previous chapter to the next chapter to provide you with a detailed reading experience.
