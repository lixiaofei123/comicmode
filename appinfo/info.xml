    <description><![CDATA[## What is it ?

This is a nextcloud plugin that can help you better read your comics stored on nextcloud

## Why install it

When you read comics on nextcloud, you may need this plugin to help you read better.

We provide a more user-friendly UI interface so that you can read it as you would on a comic site. We also support automatic identification of comic catalogs. At the same time, we provide the function of saving reading records, your browsing records will be saved on the cloud instance of nextcloud, and synchronized to your various devices.

## How to install it?

Clone this repo and put it in **nextcloud/custom_apps/** **~~nextcloud/apps/~~**

## What it can't do

it is just a tool to help you better browse comics, the plugin itself does not provide any comic resources


## Some screenshots

Suppose you have such a directory with several pictures (eg: '/comics/Fish Man/Chapter 3' )

![has-some-pics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lixiaofei123/comicmode/master/img/screenshot/has-some-pics.png)

You can see a Pac-Man icon at the back of each directory

![comic-action](https://github.com/lixiaofei123/comicmode/blob/master/img/screenshot/comic-action.png)

Click this icon to start browsing

![read](https://github.com/lixiaofei123/comicmode/blob/master/img/screenshot/read.png)

Click the table of contents in the lower right corner of the figure above to open the comic catalog

![catalog](https://github.com/lixiaofei123/comicmode/blob/master/img/screenshot/catalog.png)

Click on the Pac Man icon at the top of next cloud to view your own reading records, which are stored in the cloud instead of locally
